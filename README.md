-AlgoQuest â€” Graph Traversal Visualizer
AlgoQuest is an interactive web application designed to help users understand graph traversal algorithms through engaging and dynamic visualizations. This project aims to simplify complex concepts like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) by allowing users to visualize how nodes and edges are traversed step-by-step.

-Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: Explore BFS and DFS traversals with real-time animations.
User-Friendly Interface: Modern design with responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile users.
Algorithm Options: Seamlessly switch between traversal algorithms to compare their working mechanisms.
Custom Graphs: Users can input their own graphs to see how traversal changes.
Responsive Design: Fully adaptable for various screen sizes, with a sleek mobile navigation menu.
Feedback Section: Collects user feedback to improve functionality and user experience.

-Tech Stack
HTML5
CSS3 (with responsive design and animations)
JavaScript (for interactive graph visualizations)
p5.js (for canvas-based graph drawing and animations)

-About the Project
The goal of AlgoQuest is to bridge the gap between theory and practice by offering a hands-on experience for learners. Graph traversal is a fundamental topic in computer science, and this visualizer provides a clear, step-by-step view of how algorithms explore nodes and edges, helping beginners and enthusiasts strengthen their understanding.
